📌 Project Title: COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard
🎯 Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to visualize and analyze the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard helps users understand the trends, affected regions, and critical statistics like confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries — all in a clear and intuitive interface.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used
Component	Description
Tableau	Primary tool for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation
Excel/CSV	Likely used as the data source (e.g., WHO, JHU CSSE, or Kaggle datasets)
Calculated Fields	For creating metrics like Case Fatality Rate, Recovery Rate, etc.
Filters, Parameters, Actions	For interactivity and drill-downs within the dashboard
